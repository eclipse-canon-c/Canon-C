## Why this exists: macro modules are the exception

Canon-C's verified core stack (`checked.h` through `region.h`, plus
`semantics/error.h`) is annotated and proved **in place**: each is a header of
`static inline` functions with real bodies, and `frama-c -wp` is pointed
directly at the header, while MC/DC is measured directly from the module's test.
That works because those headers contain **concrete functions** to annotate and
cover.

Canon-C's generic modules do not. They implement generics through **macro
templates** — a module's functions are emitted by macros only when a concrete
type is instantiated — so before instantiation there is no function to annotate,
and ACSL written inside a macro body is stripped by the preprocessor before the
macro ever becomes a function. These macro modules are the **exception** to the
in-place approach, and `vmacros/` is the out-of-tree mechanism that handles them
without modifying a single line of shipped code.

## The `vmacros/` tree

```
vmacros/
├── vdrivers/     WP proof drivers (*_verify.h)  — read by frama-c -wp, never compiled
└── coverage/     MC/DC coverage TUs (*_cover.c) — compiled only by the coverage job
```

**`vdrivers/` serves WP. `coverage/` serves MC/DC.** A driver is read as a header
by `frama-c -wp` and is never compiled or executed. MC/DC condition coverage is a
separate concern with a separate artifact — a per-module
`vmacros/coverage/<module>_cover.c` — for the subset of modules that need it.
Both are fed by the **same one instantiation** of the real shipped macros. The
two are split into two subdirectories on purpose: it makes the build-isolation
rule (below) trivial to enforce — `vdrivers/` is touched only by WP,
`coverage/` only by the coverage job.

Nothing in the library includes anything from `vmacros/`. It is a proof and
coverage harness, analogous to a test tree, that lives outside the layered
module tree (`core/primitives/ → core/ → semantics/ → data/ → algo/ → util/`).

One driver exists per multi-file macro module. There are **14** such modules
across three layers, listed in the tables below — `option` and `result` have
landed; the other 12 are pending.

---

## Why the split exists: Shape A vs Shape B

A macro module's *structural shape* — not its layer, not "macro vs non-macro" —
determines what each tool can see, and therefore which artifacts it needs. This
is the single fact that governs everything below.

**Shape A — written-out bodies in `_impl.h`.** The function body is real source
lines in the `_impl.h` file. The *name* may be mangled and the *types* may be
macro parameters, but the body is written out. Examples: `map_impl.h`'s
`algo_map` (`ALGO_MAP_LINKAGE void algo_map(...) { ... for (...) ... }`),
`hashmap_impl.h`'s `_HM_INSERT` (full body with its `&&`/`||`/loop conditions on
real lines).

**Shape B — expression-macro bodies.** The body exists only as a macro that
expands at the instantiation site. Example: `option_impl.h`'s
`IMPL_OPTION_FILTER` is `{ return ((_o).has_value && (_pred)(...)) ? ... }`.
There is no `option_int_filter` anywhere in `option_impl.h` — it comes into
being only when `DEFINE_OPTION_FUNCTIONS(static inline, int)` expands inside a
`.c` file.

This distinction is the whole story for both tools, because **a Shape-B body has
no analyzable lines until some TU instantiates it:**

- **WP** verifies concrete functions. Shape-A headers go straight to `frama-c
  -wp` (this is what the nine enforced per-header jobs do). Shape-B headers are
  only macros until instantiation, so WP needs a **driver** to instantiate a
  concrete type for it to prove. (`option_verify.h` is the first such driver;
  see semantics/option in `verification.md`.)
- **MC/DC** (`gcc -fcondition-coverage` → `gcov-14 --conditions`) attributes
  each condition to the file the line resolves to **after preprocessing**. For
  Shape A the line is in `_impl.h`, so the condition is attributed there,
  survives the coverage pipeline's `/test/` exclusions, and **already appears**
  in the MC/DC table. For Shape B the line resolves to the **instantiation
  site** — today the module's `_test.c` — so the condition is attributed to a
  `/test/` path and is then deleted by `grep -v "/test/"` and
  `lcov --remove '*/test/*'`. The conditions are measured and then thrown away.
  (Confirmed on the `option` run — see "Before building the cover TUs" below.)

So Shape-A modules need nothing extra for either tool. Shape-B modules need a
driver (for WP) **and** a cover TU (for MC/DC).

### The three reasons a file is absent from the MC/DC table

When auditing coverage, a file missing from the condition-coverage table is
missing for one of three reasons. They do **not** share a fix — bucket every
absent file before applying any remedy.

1. **No conditions to cover.** Pure data/typedef/straight-line headers (e.g.
   `limits.h`, `types.h`, much of the `*_mangle.h` files) contain zero
   `&&`/`||`/`?:`/`if`. They will never appear in a condition table because there
   is nothing to measure. MC/DC is *vacuously complete*. The correct artifact is
   a one-line note in the coverage documentation ("no conditions; nothing to
   measure") — **not** a coverage row and **not** a driver.

2. **Shape-B expression-macro bodies.** `option`, `result`, `vec`, `deque`,
   `fold`. They *have* conditions and the `_test.c` files *do* exercise every
   path, but the conditions are attributed to the excluded `_test.c` and filtered
   out. This is a **measurement** problem, not a test problem — the tests are
   complete. This is the bucket the cover-TU pattern below closes. (`option` is
   the first one closed.)

3. **Never instantiated in any TU.** No test instantiates the module, so there is
   no `.gcda` and nothing to attribute anywhere. Canon-C has a `_test.c` for
   every module, so this bucket should be empty — but confirm it when auditing
   rather than assuming.

Chasing 100% on a Reason-1 file is chasing something that does not exist. Only
Reason-2 files get a cover TU.

---

## The three artifacts per Shape-B module

The instantiation a Shape-B module needs for WP is the **same** instantiation it
needs for MC/DC — one instantiation, two consumers — but the consumers take it
in two different forms, so a Shape-B module has **three** files with three
distinct jobs. Do not collapse them.

| File                  | Path                  | Consumer       | Role                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<module>_test.c`     | `test/...`            | ctest          | Functional test. Asserts correctness. Stays as-is; owns nothing new.|
| `<module>_verify.h`   | `vmacros/vdrivers/`   | `frama-c -wp`  | ACSL contracts on concrete prototypes + real-macro instantiation. Read as a header; never compiled. |
| `<module>_cover.c`    | `vmacros/coverage/`   | gcov           | `#include`s the driver, executes each generated function once. Compiled from a **non-`/test/`** path so its conditions survive the filter. |

Why three and not two: WP can consume a bare header (it preprocesses and proves
in place), but **gcov can only attribute conditions on lines a TU actually
compiles and runs** — a header is not a TU. The `_cover.c` is the executed `.c`
that gives the Shape-B conditions a home gcov keeps. Because it lives under
`vmacros/coverage/` rather than `test/`, the macro-generated conditions are
attributed to `vmacros/coverage/<module>_cover.c`, which the pipeline's
exclusions do **not** delete; and because it *runs* the functions, gcov records
real outcomes instead of `0/N`. `option_cover.c` is the first realized instance:
it measures 96.7% (29/30) at CI #1072 (MCDC-006).

**This is not a second source of truth.** `<module>_cover.c` `#include`s the
driver, which instantiates the **real shipped macros**. It is a second *caller*
of the same generated functions, not a reimplementation. There remains exactly
one source of truth — the shipped macro — exercised by two callers (`_test.c`
and `_cover.c`). The integrity rule below is preserved.

### Minimal shape of a cover TU

```c
/* vmacros/coverage/option_cover.c — NOT under test/, so not filter-excluded */
#define CANON_CONTRACT_IMPL
#include "vmacros/vdrivers/option_verify.h"   /* real instantiation; ACSL is in comments, ignored by gcc */

int main(void) {
    /* Call each generated function once so gcov records its conditions.
     * Inputs only need to toggle each condition outcome; correctness is
     * already asserted by option_test.c — this TU is for attribution. */
    option_int s = option_int_some(1), n = option_int_none();
    (void)option_int_is_some(s); (void)option_int_is_none(n);
    /* ... one call per generated function, both outcomes of each condition ... */
    return 0;
}
```

(Often derivable by stripping the `EXPECT` harness out of the existing
`_test.c`. The shipped `option_cover.c` follows exactly this shape, plus a few
scaffolding helpers — `half_if_even`, `observe_opt`, `is_positive` — to toggle
the combinator predicates; those helpers contribute 4 of the file's 30 condition
outcomes and are why the per-file split is 26 generated + 4 scaffolding. See
MCDC-006.)

### Where the recovered conditions land (attribution nuance)

gcov attributes a macro expansion's conditions to the file containing
the **expansion site**. When the cover TU takes its instantiation from
the driver `#include` — the literal one-instantiation-two-consumers
form, and the recommended one — the `DEFINE_<MODULE>_FUNCTIONS` line
sits inside `vmacros/vdrivers/<module>_verify.h`, so the generated
conditions are attributed to the **driver header**, and only the TU's
own scaffolding conditions to `vmacros/coverage/<module>_cover.c`. Both
paths are outside `test/` and survive the filter, so the measurement is
identical either way — but the per-file coverage table's row for the
module's generated conditions is the *driver header*, and regression
diagnosis must read `<module>_verify.h.gcov`, not only
`<module>_cover.c.gcov` (the CI per-line debug steps dump both).

result established this on its landing run: `result_verify.h` owns the
22 generated outcomes (22/22), `result_cover.c` its 6 scaffolding
outcomes (6/6) — MCDC-007, finding 2. Record the per-module ownership
split when each cover TU lands. option's records (MCDC-006 and the
traceability per-file prose) predate this finding and describe all 30
outcomes under `option_cover.c`; re-audit option's per-line artifact to
determine whether its 26 generated outcomes are likewise attributed to
`option_verify.h`, and align the wording if so.

### Two hard requirements on the cover TU

1. **Same `-D` flags as the WP run.** The driver is written for the WP build,
   which compiles under `-DCANON_NO_REQUIRE -DNDEBUG`. Under that flag
   `require_msg` expands to `((void)0)`, so the NULL-guard branches disappear and
   are neither proved by WP nor counted by gcov. The coverage job already defines
   `-DCANON_NO_REQUIRE` for exactly this reason — to keep MC/DC measuring the
   same code WP proves. **A cover TU MUST be compiled with the same
   `-DCANON_NO_REQUIRE -DNDEBUG`.** Compiled without it, the `require_msg`
   branches reappear as conditions, the cover TU's condition count no longer
   matches the driver's WP goal set, and the two evidence streams silently
   diverge. State this in the cover TU's CMake target; do not leave it implicit.
   (option confirms why this matters: `option_int_expect`'s panic-on-absent
   branch is the single uncovered MC/DC outcome precisely because
   `-DCANON_NO_REQUIRE` removes it — and WP independently reports that same call
   as unreachable. The flag keeps both streams pointed at the same branch.)

2. **Build isolation.** `vmacros/vdrivers/*_verify.h` is read **only** by
   `frama-c -wp` and must never be compiled into a test or coverage binary (its
   `static inline` definitions would collide with the same functions instantiated
   elsewhere in the link). `vmacros/coverage/*_cover.c` is compiled **only** in
   the coverage job and must be excluded from the `build`, `valgrind`, `fuzzing`,
   and `lifetime-debug` targets. Neither `vmacros/vdrivers/` nor
   `vmacros/coverage/` may be swept into a globbed source root — a `.c` is far
   more likely than a `.h` to be picked up by an accidental `file(GLOB ...)`,
   which would add a duplicate definition of every generated function. Add them
   as explicit, job-gated CMake targets.

## Which modules get which artifact

Shape is **confirmed** for `option`/`result` (B) and `map`/`hashmap` (A) by
reading their `_impl.h`. For the rest it is **provisional** — inferred from
presence/absence in the MC/DC table — and is confirmed per-module by the
attribution debug run (see "Before building the cover TUs" below) before its
cover TU is built. `option`'s and `result`'s attribution runs have both been
performed and confirmed; the other three Shape-B modules (`vec`, `deque`,
`fold`) still get their own confirming run.

**Cover TUs needed (Shape-B): five —** `option` (✅ landed), `result`
(✅ landed), `vec`, `deque`, `fold`. The nine Shape-A modules already surface in the MC/DC table via
their `_impl.h` bodies and get **no** cover TU. `fold` is the one algo module
absent from the table (its siblings all appear), which is why it is the only
Shape-B entry in the algo layer.

| `reverse_verify.h`  | `algo/reverse/`   | A (provisional)  | — via `reverse_impl.h`    |

The `data/vec/` and `data/hashmap/` modules carry optional 6th/7th-file
extensions (`_range`, `_fmt`) that depend on other modules (range.h,
stringbuf.h, vec.h). Whether those extension functions are verified within the
same driver or deferred is decided per-module when that driver is built; the
core decl/impl/defn surface is verified first regardless.

### Single-file macro families — separate disposition (not yet decided)

The following are also macro-templated but live in a **single file** rather than
the multi-file split, so they are a distinct category and their handling is an
open decision (annotate in place where a non-macro surface exists, give them
their own driver, or document-only per the existing macro-disposition rule):

- `DEFINE_SLICE` in `core/slice.h`
- `DEFINE_OWNED` / `CANON_DROP` in `core/ownership.h`
- `DEFINE_ARRAY` in `data/array.h`
- `DECLARE_QUEUE` in `data/queue.h`
- `DECLARE_STACK` in `data/stack.h`
- `DEFINE_BORROWED_SLICE` in `semantics/borrow.h` — note: borrow.h's
  **non-macro** surface (24 functions) is now WP-verified in place
  (VERIFY-016), the same in-place-surface + parked-family structure
  slice.h has with `DEFINE_SLICE`; that changes nothing for this list
  — the macro family's disposition remains open exactly as for
  `DEFINE_SLICE`

These are listed for completeness but are **out of scope for the initial
`vmacros/` rollout**, which targets the 14 multi-file modules above. Their
disposition is tracked separately and this document should be updated when
decided.

---

## Why this mechanism has to exist (WP detail)

Canon-C implements generics through **macro templates**. A module such as
Option is split across five files (`option_decl.h`, `option_impl.h`,
`option_defn.h`, `option_mangle.h`, plus the user-facing `option.h`), and the
actual functions are emitted by macros — `IMPL_OPTION_*`, `DEFINE_OPTION_*` —
only when a concrete type is instantiated with `CANON_OPTION(T)`.

This creates a hard problem for formal verification:

1. **There is no function to annotate.** Before instantiation, the shipped
   headers contain only macros. WP verifies concrete functions; it has nothing
   to act on until a type is instantiated.

2. **You cannot annotate the macro bodies.** ACSL annotations are C comments.
   The C preprocessor removes comments in translation **phase 3**, *before* it
   expands macros in **phase 4**. Any `/*@ ... */` written inside an
   `IMPL_OPTION_*` or `DEFINE_OPTION_*` macro is therefore deleted before the
   macro ever becomes a function. WP never sees it. This is a property of the C
   standard's translation order, not a Frama-C limitation, and it is the same
   reason the project's macro-disposition rule (see the DEFINE_SLICE precedent
   in `verification.md`) records macro bodies as "documented but not directly
   WP-verified."

The verification driver resolves both problems without modifying a single line
of shipped code. The *same* "no analyzable lines until instantiation" property
is what blinds MC/DC for Shape-B modules — which is why the cover TU exists.
`option_verify.h` (WP) and `option_cover.c` (MC/DC) are the first realized pair.

## How a verification driver works

Each driver does exactly three things, in order:

1. **Instantiate a concrete type from the real, unmodified module headers.**
   The driver `#include`s the actual shipped `_decl.h` and `_defn.h` and
   instantiates one representative type (e.g. `option_int`). The struct and
   function *bodies* are produced by the real macros — the same code a user
   compiles.

2. **Attach ACSL contracts to concrete prototypes.** Between the type
   instantiation and the body generation, the driver declares contracted
   prototypes for the generated functions:

   ```c
   /*@ assigns \nothing;
       ensures \result == o.has_value; */
   bool option_int_is_some(option_int o);
   ```

   The contract sits on a real declaration, outside any macro, so the
   preprocessor leaves it intact.

3. **Let the macros generate the bodies.** `DEFINE_OPTION_FUNCTIONS(static
   inline, int)` (etc.) then emits the real function bodies.

Frama-C's linking step **merges a contract on a declaration onto the matching
definition** — documented behaviour: *"if there are multiple ACSL
specifications for a given function, they are merged; in particular, if one
version of the function has an ACSL specification but not the other, the merged
version will have it."* So WP checks the **macro-generated body against the
contract** written on the prototype. This is exactly what `option_verify.h` does;
it proved 189/223 (VERIFY-014), with the 34 residuals all on the six combinators
that dispatch a caller-supplied function pointer (no `calls` clause for an
arbitrary callee; `\valid_function` unimplemented in Frama-C 29).

## The integrity property this preserves (read this before adding a driver)

A verification driver **instantiates the real shipped macros**. It must **never**
be a hand-written, separately-maintained "verified copy" of the module's logic.

This is the rule that keeps the verification honest:

- The proof must be about the code users actually compile. Because the driver
  instantiates the real `_impl.h`/`_defn.h` macros, there is exactly **one
  source of truth**: the shipped macro. Prove the instantiation, and you have
  proved the code that runs.
- A parallel "verified" reimplementation would create **two sources of truth**
  that can silently drift. A bug fixed in the shipped macro but not the copy
  (or vice versa) would leave WP certifying code that nobody executes — which is
  worse than no proof, because it looks like assurance while guaranteeing
  nothing. **Do not do this.**

If you cannot verify a property by instantiating the real macro, the correct
outcome is a documented residual or a deliberately weak spec — not a divergent
copy. The cover TU obeys the same rule: it `#include`s the driver and is a second
*caller*, never a reimplementation. (`option_cover.c` `#include`s
`option_verify.h` and adds only call-site scaffolding — it reimplements nothing.)

## What a driver proves, and what it does not

- **Proves:** the functional contracts of the module's operations, on the
  instantiated representative type, against the genuinely macro-generated
  bodies. This is the same strength of claim as a directly-annotated header
  (e.g. `error.h`), extended to macro-templated code.
- **Represents, does not exhaust:** verification is performed on a
  representative instantiation (typically a primitive type such as `int`, and
  where layout matters, a small struct). The claim is that the *code the macros
  generate* is correct; it is demonstrated on the chosen instantiation(s), not
  separately re-proved for every `T` a user might instantiate. This is the
  standard macro-family disposition already used in the project. (`option` is
  verified at `CANON_OPTION(int)`; `result` at `CANON_RESULT(int, VErr)`, with
  distinct T/E types so the payload union is genuinely two-typed.)

## File-placement conventions

- One driver per macro module, named `<module>_verify.h`, in `vmacros/vdrivers/`.
- Drivers `#include` the **real** module headers by relative path; they never
  copy module logic.
- Each driver instantiates the **minimum** representative type set needed to
  reach the module's behaviour (commonly one primitive; add a struct type only
  where struct layout or by-value semantics must be exercised).
- Each verified module gets a matching CI job (`frama-c-<module>`) that runs WP
  over its driver with a zero-residual (or documented-residual) enforcement
  gate, mirroring the existing per-header WP jobs. (`frama-c-option` enforces
  189/223 with 34 named residuals, as of CI #1067; `frama-c-result` enforces
  185/215 with 30, as of CI #1090.)
- **Shape-B modules only:** a cover TU `vmacros/coverage/<module>_cover.c` that
  `#include`s the driver and drives every generated function once — compiled
  **only** in the coverage job, with the same `-DCANON_NO_REQUIRE -DNDEBUG` the
  WP job uses, and kept out of every other build target and out of any globbed
  source root. See the two hard requirements above.
- Both `vmacros/vdrivers/` and `vmacros/coverage/` come into existence with
  their first real file — neither is created empty ahead of need. (Both now
  exist: `option_verify.h` and `option_cover.c` are their first occupants.)

## Before building the cover TUs: confirm the attribution

The cover-TU rollout rests on the claim that GCC attributes Shape-B conditions to
the instantiation TU (`_test.c`) rather than to `_impl.h`. That is strongly
supported by reading `option_impl.h` (Shape B) against `map_impl.h` /
`hashmap_impl.h` (Shape A), but **confirm it on one real run before building five
cover TUs.**

The confirming experiment is a report-only debug step (mirroring the existing
per-header `Debug: per-line MC/DC detail for ...` steps in the coverage job):
dump `option_test`'s raw `gcov-14 --conditions` output next to `map_test`'s as a
known-working Shape-A control, and check **which file owns the `option_int_*`
conditions**:

- If they are attributed to `option_test.c` (expected): the cover-TU pattern is
  the correct fix; roll it out per Shape-B module.
- If `option_impl.h` appears instead: the conditions are *not* lost to
  attribution — the filter is simply too aggressive — and the fix is a single
  narrower `lcov --remove` / `grep` change that recovers **all** Shape-B files at
  once, with no cover TUs at all. Far cheaper; prefer it if it applies.

Do not build the five cover TUs before this run. A one-line filter change may
close the whole bucket.

### Resolved (option, CI #1072)

The attribution run was performed on `option` and **the expected branch held**:
`option_test`'s `gcov-14 --conditions` output attributes the `option_int_*`
combinator conditions to **`option_test.c`** (the instantiation TU), not to
`option_impl.h`. The `map_test` Shape-A control behaved as its counterpart —
its conditions resolve into `map_impl.h` and survive the filter. So the Shape-B
conditions are genuinely lost to the `/test/` exclusion, the cheaper one-line
`lcov --remove` / `grep` narrowing does **not** recover them, and the cover-TU
pattern is the correct fix.

`vmacros/coverage/option_cover.c` was built on that basis and measures **96.7%
(29/30)** at CI #1072 — MCDC-006. The single miss is `option_int_expect`'s
panic-on-absent branch, unreachable under `-DCANON_NO_REQUIRE` and
cross-confirmed by WP (which reports the handler call as a non-terminating
recursive call that "must be unreachable"). The 30 outcomes split as **26
generated `option_int_*` conditions + 4 cover-driver scaffolding conditions**
(`half_if_even`'s even-check and `observe_opt`'s `get`-result branch).

This is module-specific evidence, not a blanket clearance. It confirms the
*pattern* — Shape-B macro conditions attribute to the instantiation TU and need
a cover TU — and the then-remaining Shape-B modules (`result`, `vec`,
`deque`, `fold`) inherit that confirmed pattern (result's own confirming run
has since landed — see the next subsection). But each should still get the same
one-run attribution check before its own cover TU is built, since a module could
in principle write its body shape differently; the per-module confirmation is
cheap and stays in the checklist.

### Resolved (result, CI #1089)

result's per-module attribution check ran as a report-only debug step
in the same coverage run that landed its cover TU, and **the confirmed
pattern held**: `result_test`'s `gcov-14 --conditions` output
attributes all 256 of the module's measured condition outcomes to
**`result_test.c`** (the instantiation TU, covering both the
`(int, MyError)` and `(Point, MyError)` instantiations plus test
scaffolding), with `result_impl.h` owning none — so the conditions are
genuinely lost to the `/test/` exclusion and the cover TU is the
correct fix for result too.

`vmacros/coverage/result_cover.c` measures **100% (28/28)** at CI
#1089 — MCDC-007, the first *clean* Shape-B audit. No analogue of
option's `expect` ceiling exists: result's entire panic surface routes
through `require_msg` and vanishes under `-DCANON_NO_REQUIRE`, so no
panic branch survives into the measured set (the same fact leaves
result's WP run with no handler-call goals of its own — VERIFY-015).
The 28 outcomes split **22 generated `result_int_VErr_*` conditions
(attributed to `result_verify.h` — see the attribution nuance above) +
6 cover-driver scaffolding conditions (`checked_double`'s threshold and
`observe_res`'s two `get_*`-result branches, attributed to
`result_cover.c`)**, all covered.

Two Shape-B modules now confirm the pattern independently. The
per-module attribution check remains in the checklist for `vec`,
`deque`, and `fold`, and MCDC-007's forward note governs their audit
expectations: the module's panic-surface routing (require_msg-only vs
handler-invoking) determines clean audit vs ceiling entry — do not
assume either.

The `vmacros/` tree now holds two driver + cover-TU pairs (`option`,
`result`). Update each remaining row's WP status as its driver is
written, and the Cover-TU column as each Shape-B cover TU lands (and as
provisional Shape classifications are confirmed by the per-module
attribution debug run); record each module's generated-vs-scaffolding
attribution split per the attribution-nuance note above. The six
single-file macro families are tracked separately and are not part of
this table until their disposition is decided.
