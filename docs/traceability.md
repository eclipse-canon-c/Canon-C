### Results

| Metric     | Percentage | Covered    | Total      |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Lines      | 95.7%      | 2163       | 2261       |
| Functions  | 99.6%      | 512        | 514        |
| Branches   | 85.5%      | 1418       | 1658       |
| MC/DC      | 84.8%      | 1381       | 1628       |

memory.h's MC/DC contribution rose from 82.0% (105/128) at the
pre-Phase-1 baseline to 88.3% (113/128) at the Phase-1+ACSL baseline.
The 8-outcome improvement comes from the `mem_alloc_array_checked`
refactor — extracting the previously-inlined arithmetic into a
verified primitive function exposes the overflow-detection branches
(via `checked_mul`) directly to the test suite, where 3 dedicated
overflow tests in `test_mem_alloc_array_*` exercise the
fallback-and-error paths that were previously dead-coded inside the
macro expansion. The 15 remaining missed outcomes are defensive
`require_msg` checks under `-DCANON_NO_REQUIRE`, the same coverage
methodology pattern documented in MCDC-001.

### Methodology changes since baseline

**CANON_CHECKED_FORCE_FALLBACK** (added 2026-04-14): Forces the portable
fallback path in checked.h instead of compiler builtins.

**CANON_BITS_FORCE_FALLBACK** (added 2026-04-17): Same rationale for
bits.h — forces the portable fallback paths for popcount, clz, ctz,
and bswap instead of compiler builtins.

**CANON_NO_REQUIRE** (added 2026-04-14): Compiles `require_msg()` to
`((void)0)`, removing NULL-check branches that ACSL `requires \valid(result)`
has already proved unreachable under Frama-C. contract_test is excluded
from the coverage build for the same reason.

### Notable per-header results

Headers at 100% MC/DC:

`bits.h`, `checked.h`, `compare.h`, `ptr.h`, `error.h`, `str_view.h`,
`time.h`, `map_impl.h`, `filter_impl.h`, `find_impl.h`, `reverse_impl.h`,
`search_impl.h`, `any_all_impl.h`, `unique_impl.h`

The `checked.h` 100% MC/DC result holds at the new 96/96 condition-outcome
denominator (up from 64/64) following the addition of 12 division and
modulo functions. Each new function adds exactly one zero-check branch
plus, for the signed `_isize` variants, an additional `&&` short-circuit
pair for the `ISIZE_MIN / -1` overflow guard. All new conditions are
exercised by the dedicated `checked_div_*_op`, `checked_mod_*_op`,
`checked_div_isize_mcdc`, and `checked_mod_isize_mcdc` test groups in
`test/core/primitives/checked_test.c`.

Headers at their documented MC/DC ceiling (below 100% by design or
by methodology):

- **slice.h: 93.1% (54/58)** — the achievable ceiling under the
  public-API constraint documented in MCDC-002. The 4 remaining
  outcomes are the `!ptr` left-side of `||` in `bytes_slice` (line
  117), `bytes_skip` (line 130), `str_slice` (line 194), and
  `str_skip` (line 207). All four are unreachable in MC/DC isolation
  through the public API and are formally proved unreachable by
  Frama-C WP under the `bytes_invariant` / `str_invariant` type
  predicates (see VERIFY-007 and the MCDC-002 status update). The
  gcov measurement remains 54/58 because gcov instruments the source
  rather than the proof — the two evidence streams complement each
  other rather than converge.

- **memory.h: 88.3% (113/128)** — the ceiling under the
  `-DCANON_NO_REQUIRE` methodology documented in MCDC-001. The 15
  missed outcomes are defensive `require_msg` checks at the entry of
  alignment, allocation, and copy functions; ACSL `requires` clauses
  provide the static guarantee these checks enforce at runtime, so
  the coverage build removes them and the WP proof discharges the
  same precondition obligations statically. memory.h does not add a
  new MCDC-002-style deviation — its bytes_t/cbytes_t variants
  inherit slice.h's `bytes_invariant`, so the analogous `!ptr`
  branches are discharged by the inherited type invariant rather
  than re-introducing public-API-unreachable code.

## Formal verification status

Per-header formal verification state (see `docs/verification.md` for
full per-header detail):

| Header     | Functions | Proof obligations | Proved (auto)     | Unproved | Deviation    |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| checked.h  | 30        | 1755              | 1753 (99.89%)     | 2        | VERIFY-002   |
| bits.h     | 18        |  761              |  746 (98.03%)     | 15       | VERIFY-003/4 |
| compare.h  | 28        |  208              |  208 (100%)       | 0        | VERIFY-005   |
| ptr.h      | 21        | 1739              | 1729 (99.43%)     | 10       | VERIFY-006   |
| slice.h    | 22        |  390              |  367 (94.10%)     | 23       | VERIFY-007   |
| memory.h   | 27        | 2862              | 2805 (98.01%)     | 57       | VERIFY-008   |
| **Total**  | **146**   | **7715**          | **7608 (98.61%)** | **107**  |              |

**Prover setup**: Alt-Ergo 2.6.3 + Z3 4.15.2 + CVC5 1.2.1 (triple-prover,
`-wp-timeout 120`). All 107 unproved goals are demonstrated
triple-prover-resistant and carry written manual-proof arguments or
documented WP feature-gap rationale in `docs/deviations.md`.

**Note on totals**: the 7715 figure is the row-sum of independent
per-header WP runs, where each row reports each header's own
obligations (substrate goals are counted under their owning header,
not duplicated into downstream rows). The CI WP step for ptr.h
actually reports 1943/1953 because it processes ptr.h's translation
unit including checked.h, but those +214 obligations belong to
checked.h's row, not ptr.h's. Similarly, memory.h's CI step processes
memory.h with ptr.h, slice.h, checked.h, and contract.h all
transitively included; the 2862 figure for memory.h reflects the
full run, but is shown here as memory.h's row because memory.h is
the verification target. 31 of memory.h's 57 unproved goals are
re-emerged residuals already documented under VERIFY-002/006/007
(see VERIFY-008).

The slice.h baseline (367 / 390) carries a higher residual fraction
(5.9%) than the previously verified primitives headers because slice.h
is the first Canon-C header that crosses the C standard library
boundary — its equality functions call `memcmp` and `str_from_cstr`
calls `strlen`, both of which have ACSL contracts requiring
initialization and danglingness reasoning that Frama-C 29 has not yet
implemented (see VERIFY-007 for the full WP warning text). The 23
slice.h residuals are not specific to slice.h's design; future headers
that use these libc functions will incur the same residual category.

The memory.h baseline (2805 / 2862) is the first Canon-C verification
round where inherited residuals from substrate headers exceed
memory.h-own residuals — 31 of 57 are byte-identical to goals already
documented in VERIFY-002/006/007, re-emerging because memory.h
includes those headers transitively. The 26 memory.h-own residuals
fall into three categories that are each rooted in a Frama-C feature
gap (\fresh/\freeable allocation reasoning, bitwise-alignment integer
theory, memcmp call-site initialization/danglingness). All 26 are
documented in VERIFY-008 with manual-proof arguments. The 31:26
inherited:own ratio is the first quantitative data point for the
composable-verification thesis: substrate residuals propagate without
amplification across composition layers.

The checked.h baseline grew by 214 proof obligations (1541 → 1755) when
the division and modulo functions were added. All 214 new obligations
were discharged automatically — most by Qed, with smaller contributions
from Alt-Ergo and from WP's structural categories (Terminating /
Unreachable). The two manually-discharged goals are unchanged from
the previous baseline.

### Cross-stream evidence: MCDC-002 closure

slice.h's MC/DC ceiling at 93.1% (54/58) and slice.h's WP discharge
of the four MCDC-002 functions form complementary certification
evidence. gcov reports the four `!ptr` defensive branches as uncovered
because no test reaches them through the public API. WP proves the
same four branches are unreachable for any caller satisfying the
type invariant. The gcov measurement is honest about test coverage;
the WP discharge is honest about formal reachability. Together they
satisfy DO-178C's intent for "deactivated code" or "defensive code
unreachable in normal operation" without removing the defensive
checks: the verification framework provides the unreachability
evidence the testing framework cannot. See MCDC-002 in
`docs/deviations.md` for the formal closure record.

memory.h does not extend the MCDC-002 list because its bytes_t/cbytes_t
variants inherit slice.h's `bytes_invariant` — the analogous `!ptr`
defensive branches are discharged by the inherited invariant rather
than introducing new public-API-unreachable code paths. Future
headers that introduce their own public {ptr, len} types (arena.h,
pool.h, stringbuf.h are candidates) will need their own per-header
MCDC analyses; memory.h does not.
