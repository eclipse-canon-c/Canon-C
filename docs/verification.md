# Verification Record

## Overview

This document records the formal verification status of Canon-C library
headers. Verification is performed using Frama-C WP (Weakest Precondition)
with ACSL contracts, enforced in CI on every push to master.

Combined verification status across all annotated headers:

| Metric               | Value                                          |

| **Headers verified** | 4 (checked.h, bits.h, compare.h, ptr.h)        |
| **Functions**        | 102 annotated and verified                     |
| **Total obligations**| 4463                                            |

### Function inventory

The 30 functions split into two groups by verification approach:

**Overflow-detecting arithmetic (18 functions):** `checked_add`,
`checked_add_u8/u16/u32/u64`, `checked_sub`, `checked_sub_u8/u16/u32/u64`,
`checked_mul`, `checked_mul_u8/u16/u32/u64`, `checked_add_isize`,
`checked_sub_isize`, `checked_mul_isize`. These functions use compiler
builtins (`__builtin_*_overflow`) on GCC/Clang with portable fallback
paths for verification under `__FRAMAC__` (see VERIFY-001).

**UB-detecting division and modulo (12 functions):** `checked_div`,
`checked_div_u8/u16/u32/u64`, `checked_div_isize`, `checked_mod`,
`checked_mod_u8/u16/u32/u64`, `checked_mod_isize`. These functions
have no compiler builtin equivalent — `__builtin_div_overflow` does
not exist. They are implemented directly in C under all build
configurations and verified directly without the `__FRAMAC__`
workaround. The verified code is the executed code.

### What is proved

- **Functional correctness**: Every function's ACSL contract (requires,
  ensures, assigns, behaviors) is verified for all possible inputs
  consistent with the preconditions. Behaviors are marked `complete`
  and `disjoint`, ensuring the specification is exhaustive and
  non-overlapping.

  For overflow-detecting functions, behaviors are
  `no_overflow` / `overflow` (with an additional `zero` behavior on
  multiplication for `a == 0 || b == 0`).

  For division and modulo, behaviors are `ok` / `div_by_zero` for
  unsigned variants, and `ok` / `div_by_zero` / `overflow` for the
  signed isize variants (where `overflow` captures the
  `ISIZE_MIN / -1` and `ISIZE_MIN % -1` UB cases).

- **Absence of runtime errors** (`-wp-rte`): WP proves that no
  execution of any function can trigger:
  - Signed integer overflow
  - Division by zero
  - Invalid shift operations
  - Null pointer dereference
  - Out-of-bounds memory access

- **Side-effect bounding**: Every function specifies `assigns *result;`,
  proving that no memory other than `*result` is modified.

### Prover breakdown

| Category       | Goals discharged | Typical time      |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Terminating    | 30               | (structural)      |
| Unreachable    | 30               | (structural)      |
| Qed (internal) | 1587             | 1ms–10ms          |
| Alt-Ergo 2.6.3 | 92               | 14ms–47ms         |
| CVC5 1.2.1     | 3                | 79ms–268ms        |
| Z3 4.15.2      | 11               | 18ms–72ms         |
| Timeout        | 2                | >120s (see below) |
| **Total**      | **1753 / 1755**  |                    |

`Terminating` and `Unreachable` are WP's structural categories for
goals that are discharged without invoking an SMT solver — termination
proofs and unreachable-by-construction proof obligations. They count
toward the proved total alongside the prover-discharged goals.

The division and modulo functions added 214 new proof obligations
over the previous baseline (1541 → 1755). All 214 were discharged
automatically — most by Qed (`+174`) plus contributions from Alt-Ergo
and the structural categories. Z3 and CVC5 were not invoked on any
new goal, confirming that the div/mod contracts require no nonlinear
or modular reasoning. The two manually-discharged goals are unchanged
from the previous baseline (both belong to the original add-overflow
functions).

### Manually discharged goals

Two proof obligations are not discharged by any automated prover
(demonstrated **triple-prover-resistant** under Alt-Ergo + Z3 + CVC5):

1. **`typed_checked_add_overflow_ensures`**
2. **`typed_checked_add_u64_overflow_ensures`**

Both assert that when `a > USIZE_MAX - b` (or `a > 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF - b`),
the function returns `false`. The fallback implementation computes
`*result = a + b` (unsigned wraparound, well-defined in C) and returns
`*result >= a`, which is `false` when overflow occurred.

**Why provers fail**: WP formulates this in its integer memory model where
unsigned wraparound requires modular-arithmetic reasoning. None of
Alt-Ergo 2.6.3, Z3 4.15.2, or CVC5 1.2.1 close this goal because the
relationship between the mathematical sum and the wrapped result requires
reasoning about `(a + b) mod 2^64`, which is outside their default
integer theory.

**Manual proof**: When `a > USIZE_MAX - b`, the mathematical sum
`a + b > USIZE_MAX`. Under C's unsigned wraparound semantics,
`*result = (a + b) mod 2^N` where N is the width. Since the true sum
exceeds `2^N - 1`, the wrapped result satisfies
`*result = (a + b) - 2^N < a` (because `b >= 1` and the wrap subtracts
`2^N`). Therefore `*result >= a` is `false`, and the function correctly
returns `false`. QED.

**Verification**: The CI wrapper explicitly checks that exactly these
two goals time out and no others. Any additional timeout is a regression
and fails the build. The full WP output is uploaded as the
`wp-proof-checked` CI artifact for auditor inspection.

### Preprocessing flags

- **`-DCANON_NO_REQUIRE`**: Compiles `CHECKED_ASSERT_RESULT(result)` to
  `((void)0)`. The ACSL `requires \valid(result)` clause provides the
  corresponding static guarantee.

- **`-DNDEBUG`**: Standard release-mode flag. Combined with
  `CANON_NO_REQUIRE`, ensures the preprocessed source contains only the
  arithmetic logic, not the assertion infrastructure.

### Reproduction

```bash
frama-c -wp -wp-rte \
  -wp-prover alt-ergo,z3,cvc5 \
  -wp-timeout 120 \
  -wp-split \
  -cpp-extra-args=" \
    -I core/primitives \
    -I core \
    -I . \
    -DCANON_NO_REQUIRE \
    -DNDEBUG" \
  core/primitives/checked.h
```

Expected output: `Proved goals: 1753 / 1755` with exactly 2 timeouts.

### What is proved

- **Functional correctness** for simple bit operations: `bits_test`,
  `bits_set`, `bits_toggle`, `bits_extract`, `bits_is_power_of_two`,
  `bits_ffs`, `bits_fls` — full behavioral specs with `complete` and
  `disjoint` behaviors.

- **Range and zero properties** for complex algorithms: `bits_clz`,
  `bits_ctz`, `bits_popcount` — range bounds proved, zero behavior
  proved exactly.

- **Absence of runtime errors** (`-wp-rte`) for most functions.

- **Side-effect bounding**: Every function specifies `assigns \nothing;`.

### Prover breakdown

| Prover         | Goals discharged | Typical time      |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Qed (internal) | 701              | 1ms–12ms          |

| **Total**      | **746 / 761**    |                    |

Note: CVC5 1.2.1 is invoked as a tertiary prover on this header but
closes none of the 15 unproved goals — they are demonstrated
triple-prover-resistant.

### Timeout goals (15)

All 15 are WP model limitations on bitwise reasoning. Grouped by root cause:

**Bitwise complement (3):** `bits_clear`, `bits_insert` — WP cannot
connect C's `~x` to XOR-based ACSL spec.

**SWAR popcount (1):** `bits_popcount` — magic constants + multiplication
beyond SMT reasoning.

**Rotation RTE + spec (4):** `bits_rotl`, `bits_rotr` — RTE shift check
on `64 - shift` and bitwise OR in spec.

**Next-power-of-two minimality (4):** `bits_next_power_of_two` — the
`result / 2 < value` property through bit-smearing.

**Byte swap (3):** `bits_bswap16` signed overflow RTE (u16→int promotion),
`bits_bswap32`/`bits_bswap64` multi-term OR spec timeout.

Note: Some goals may appear as `[Unknown]` instead of `[Timeout]` across
runs — WP solver heuristics are nondeterministic. The CI enforcement
counts both combined.

### Reproduction

Expected output: `Proved goals: 746 / 761` with 15 unproved goals.

### What is proved

- **Functional correctness**: Every comparator's result is bounded to
  {-1, 0, +1}. The `(x > y) - (x < y)` branchless pattern is proved
  to always produce exactly these three values for all possible inputs.

- **Absence of runtime errors** (`-wp-rte`): WP proves no execution
  can trigger invalid memory access, signed overflow, division by zero,
  or null dereference — including through the void* → typed pointer
  casts in the function bodies.

- **Side-effect bounding**: Every function specifies `assigns \nothing;`,
  proving all comparators are pure functions.

- **Memory safety through void* casts**: The `-wp-model Typed+Cast`
  memory model allows WP to reason about the void* → typed pointer
  casts that every comparator performs. With the default `Typed` model,
  WP treats void* as char* and cannot connect char-level validity to
  typed pointer dereferences. `Typed+Cast` resolves this cleanly.

### Prover breakdown

| Prover         | Goals discharged | Typical time      |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Qed (internal) | 148              | 1ms–4ms           |
| Alt-Ergo 2.6.3 | 36               | 16ms–56ms         |
| Timeout        | 0                |                    |
| **Total**      | **208 / 208**    |                    |

Note: Z3 4.15.2 and CVC5 1.2.1 are invoked as secondary and tertiary
provers but all 60 non-Qed goals are closed by Alt-Ergo alone on this
header.

### WP memory model note

compare.h uses `-wp-model Typed+Cast` instead of the default `Typed`
model. This is necessary because every comparator takes `const void*`
parameters and casts them to typed pointers inside the function body
(e.g. `*(const u32*)a`). Frama-C's WP treats `void*` as `char*`
(sint8*) internally. With the default `Typed` model, the cast from
sint8* to uint32* is flagged as incompatible and all RTE mem_access
goals become unprovable (`Stronger` status). `Typed+Cast` relaxes
the memory model to allow these casts, which is sound because the
callers always pass correctly-typed pointers — the void* is a C
generics mechanism, not a type-punning operation.

This flag is applied to compare.h and ptr.h (both use void* → typed
pointer casts). checked.h and bits.h do not use void* parameters and
work correctly with the default `Typed` model.

### ACSL contract conventions

- All contracts use byte-level validity: `\valid_read((char *)a + (0 .. sizeof(T) - 1))`
  instead of typed-pointer validity. This avoids the incompatible-cast
  warnings in the ACSL preconditions (the `Typed+Cast` model handles
  the cast inside the function body, not in the contract).

- All functions specify `assigns \nothing;` (28 of 28).

- Range ensures: `ensures -1 <= \result <= 1` on all 28 functions.

- Floating-point comparators (4 functions) have behavioral specs with
  `complete` and `disjoint` behaviors covering NaN × NaN, NaN × normal,
  normal × NaN, and normal × normal cases using `\is_NaN`.

### Reproduction

```bash
frama-c -wp -wp-rte \
  -wp-model Typed+Cast \
  -wp-prover alt-ergo,z3,cvc5 \
  -wp-timeout 120 \
  -wp-split \

    -I core \
    -I . \
    -DCANON_NO_REQUIRE \
    -DNDEBUG" \
  core/primitives/compare.h
```

Expected output: `Proved goals: 208 / 208` with 0 timeouts.

### What is proved

- **Functional correctness**: Every function's ACSL contract is
  verified — alignment predicates (`is_power_of_two`, `is_aligned`),
  alignment arithmetic (`align_up`, `align_down`, `align_padding`),
  pointer arithmetic (`ptr_offset`, `ptr_retreat`, `ptr_diff`,
  `ptr_span`), bounds checking (`ptr_in_range`, `ptr_range_in_range`,
  `ptr_is_valid`, `ptr_is_aligned`), and element indexing
  (`ptr_elem`, `ptr_elem_const`, `ptr_or`, `ptr_or_const`). Behaviors
  are marked `complete` and `disjoint` where applicable.

- **Absence of runtime errors** (`-wp-rte`): WP proves no execution
  can trigger signed overflow, division by zero, invalid shifts, null
  dereference, or out-of-bounds access — including through the
  pointer-to-integer casts used in alignment computations.

- **Side-effect bounding**: Every function specifies `assigns \nothing;`.
  All functions are pure with respect to memory.

### Prover breakdown

| Prover         | Goals discharged | Typical time      |

| **Total**      | **1729 / 1739**  |                    |

### Timeout goals (10)

All 10 are documented as **triple-prover-resistant** under Alt-Ergo
2.6.3 + Z3 4.15.2 + CVC5 1.2.1. They fall into four categories:

**Transitive checked.h overflow (2):**
`typed_cast_checked_add_overflow_ensures`,
`typed_cast_checked_add_u64_overflow_ensures` — the same two goals
documented in VERIFY-002 (checked.h), re-emitted when checked.h is
included in the ptr.h proof run.

**Align formula ensures (3):** `typed_cast_align_up_ensures`,
`typed_cast_align_down_ensures`, `typed_cast_align_padding_ensures` —
WP's integer theory cannot reason across the bitwise AND with
complement (`~(a - 1)`) in the alignment formula
`(n + a - 1) & ~(a - 1)` relative to arithmetic multiples-of-a equality.

**Ptr_align call-chain preconditions (3):**
`typed_cast_ptr_align_up_call_align_up_requires_3`,
`typed_cast_ptr_align_padding_call_align_padding_requires_3`,
`typed_cast_ptr_align_padding_nonnull_ensures_part2` — arise when
ptr.h call sites reconstruct align_up / align_padding preconditions
through pointer-to-integer (`uintptr_t`) casts. The Typed+Cast model
allows the casts but cannot carry the numeric bounds across the
round-trip.

**Contract handler non-termination (2):**
`typed_cast_contract_default_handler_loop_invariant_established`,
`typed_cast_contract_default_handler_terminates` — under `__FRAMAC__`,
contract.h replaces `contract_default_handler`'s body with `while(1) {}`,
the standard ACSL idiom for a non-returning function. WP correctly
identifies the function as non-terminating; the `terminates` goal and
the loop-invariant establishment goal are unprovable by construction,
which is the intended semantics of a panic handler.

Full goal list and manual proof arguments: see VERIFY-006 in
docs/deviations.md.

### WP memory model note

ptr.h uses `-wp-model Typed+Cast` for the same reason as compare.h:
byte-level pointer arithmetic in `ptr_offset`, `ptr_retreat`,
`ptr_elem` and related functions performs `void*` → `u8*` casts to
compute byte offsets. The soundness argument (ISO C99 §6.3.2.3¶7) is
identical: callers supply correctly-aligned pointers, and the casts
preserve the referenced byte range.

### ACSL contract conventions

- Pointer validity uses byte-level ranges: `\valid((char *)p + (0 .. size - 1))`
  to allow Typed+Cast to bridge the void* → u8* conversion.

- All functions specify `assigns \nothing;` (26 of 26). The
  `wp:pedantic-assigns` warnings observed in the CI output are
  advisory — they note that pointer-returning functions would benefit
  from `assigns \result \from ...` clauses for tighter caller
  assumptions. This is a precision-refinement opportunity for future
  work, not a soundness concern.

- Contract handler (`core/primitives/contract.h`) under `__FRAMAC__`
  uses `ensures \false` + `exits \false` + `terminates \false` +
  `loop invariant \false` to specify non-returning semantics. The two
  resulting unproved goals (see Category 4 above) are the ACSL
  manifestation of the non-termination contract and are correct by
  construction.

### Preprocessing flags

- **`-DCANON_NO_REQUIRE`**: Same as checked.h — compiles runtime NULL
  checks away; ACSL `requires` clauses provide static guarantees.

- **`-DNDEBUG`**: Standard release-mode flag.

### Reproduction

```bash
frama-c -wp -wp-rte \
  -wp-model Typed+Cast \
  -wp-prover alt-ergo,z3,cvc5 \
  -wp-timeout 120 \
  -wp-split \
  -cpp-extra-args=" \
    -I core/primitives \
    -I core \
    -I . \
    -DCANON_NO_REQUIRE \
    -DNDEBUG" \
  core/primitives/ptr.h
```

Expected output: `Proved goals: 1729 / 1739` with 10 timeouts.

## Triple-prover rationale

Canon-C's verification baseline uses three SMT provers in sequence:
**Alt-Ergo 2.6.3**, **Z3 4.15.2**, and **CVC5 1.2.1**. WP invokes them
in that order, falling through on timeout. Each prover handles a
different class of goal well:

- **Alt-Ergo 2.6.3** — fastest on linear integer arithmetic and
  first-order ACSL contracts. Discharges the majority of non-Qed
  goals in milliseconds.
- **Z3 4.15.2** — stronger on nonlinear integer reasoning (e.g. the
  division-based overflow checks in `checked_mul_isize`) and on goals
  involving arrays and quantifiers.
- **CVC5 1.2.1** — contributes additional proofs on goals where
  Alt-Ergo and Z3 time out. Observed contributions: 3 goals on
  checked.h and 3 goals on ptr.h discharged by CVC5 that neither
  Alt-Ergo nor Z3 could close.

The practical consequence: **every remaining unproved goal (2 on
checked.h, 15 on bits.h, 10 on ptr.h) is demonstrated triple-prover-
resistant**. This is a stronger certification-evidence statement than
dual-prover resistance — the goals are genuinely limited by WP's
encoding and integer theory, not by prover strength.

### CVC5 installation note

The opam `cvc5` package (currently 1.3.0) ships only the OCaml library
bindings used by Frama-C plugins, not the standalone CLI binary that
Why3 needs for `-wp-prover cvc5`. The Canon-C CI installs the prebuilt
CVC5 1.2.1 binary directly from the official cvc5 GitHub release and
registers it with Why3 using `why3 config add-prover` (Why3 1.7.2's
auto-detection regex only recognizes CVC5 1.0.x, so manual registration
is required). See the `frama-c` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for
the complete installation and registration procedure.
